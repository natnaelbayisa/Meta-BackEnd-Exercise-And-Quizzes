Question 1
True or False: A class can serve as a base class for many derived classes. 

1 / 1 point

True


False

Correct
Correct! Theoretically it can be superclass for infinite subclasses.  

2.
Question 2
In case of multiple inheritance where C is a derived class inheriting from both class A and B, and where a and b are the respective objects for these classes, which of the following code will inherit the classes A and B correctly? (Select all that apply)

1 / 1 point

class C(B, A)

Correct
Correct! Code works irrespective of the order the classes are passed. 


class(a, B)


class C(A, B)

Correct
Correct! Code works irrespective of the order the classes are passed. 


class (a, b)

Question 3
In Example 3 of the previous exercise, if we had modified the code to include a global variable ‘a = 5’ as follows:

a = 5
class A:
      a = 7
      pass

class B(A):
      pass

class C(B):
      pass

c = C()
print(c.a())

Question 3
In Example 3 of the previous exercise, if we had modified the code to include a global variable ‘a = 5’ as follows:

13
a = 5
class A:
      a = 7
      pass

class B(A):
      pass

class C(B):
      pass

c = C()
print(c.a())
Will the code work and what will be the output if it does?

1 / 1 point

Yes and it will print the value 7


Yes and it will print the value 5


No

Correct
Correct! As the print statement is over the object c. 


4.
Question 4
What function can be used other than mro() to see the way classes are inherited in a given piece of code?

1 / 1 point

class()


info()


help()


dir()

Correct
Correct! help() can be used other than mro() to see the way classes are inherited in a given piece of code.

5.
Question 5
The super() function is used to? (Select all that apply)

1 / 1 point

call child class __init__()

Correct
Correct! It is called over child class __init__() and refers parent class __init__()


call different parent class method


called over the __init__() method of the class it is called from

Correct
Correct. That will refer the __init__() of parent class. 

6.
Question 6
What is the type of inheritance in the code below:

class A():
    pass
class B(A):
    pass
class C(B):
    pass



Single


Multiple


Hierarchical


Multi-level

Correct
Correct! Multi-level is the type of inheritance in the code
