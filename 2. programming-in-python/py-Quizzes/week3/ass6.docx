Question 3
How will you modify the code below if you want to include a “year” of publication in the output?

    print("Who wrote this?")

    def hand_list(self, philosopher, book):
        print(MyFirstClass.index)
        print(philosopher + " wrote the book: " + book)
whodunnit = MyFirstClass()
whodunnit.hand_list("Sun Tzu", "The Art of War")

class MyFirstClass():
print("Who wrote this?")
index = "Author-Book"
def hand_list(self, philosopher, book, year):
print(MyFirstClass.index)
print(philosopher + " wrote the book: " + book + "Published on " + str(year) )
whodunnit = MyFirstClass()
whodunnit.hand_list("Sun Tzu", "The Art of War", 1990)

Modify line numbers 4, 6 and 8 such as:

def hand_list(self, philosopher, book, year):

print(philosopher + " wrote the book: " + book + “in the year ” + year)
 

whodunnit.hand_list("Sun Tzu", "The Art of War", “5th century BC”)
