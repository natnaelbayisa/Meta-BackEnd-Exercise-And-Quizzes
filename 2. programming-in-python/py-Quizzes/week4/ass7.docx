1.
Question 1
Python is an interpreted language. Which of the following statements correctly describes an interpreted language?

1 / 1 point

Python will save all code first prior to running. 


Python needs to be built prior to it being run.


The source code is pre-built and compiled before running.


The source code is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.

Correct
Correct! Unlink other programming languages Python does not need to be built or linked for the code to run.

2.
Question 2
Why is indentation important in Python?

1 / 1 point

The code will compile faster with indentation. 


Python used indentation to determine which code block starts and ends. 


It makes the code more readable. 


The code will be read in a sequential manner

Correct
Correct! Python does not use curly braces like other languages, so it leverages off indentation to determine where the code blocks start and end.

3.
Question 3
What will be the output of the following code?

names = ["Anna", "Natasha", "Mike"]
names.insert(2, "Xi")
print(names)



[“Anna”, “Xi”, ”Mike” ]


[“Anna”, “Natasha”, “Xi”, “Mike”]


[“Anna”, “Natasha”, Xi]


[“Anna”, “Natasha”, 2, “Xi”, “Mike”]

Correct
Correct! The insert() function displaces the remaining list after inserting the element passed. 

4.
Question 4
What will be the output of the code below?

for x in range(1, 4):
    print(int((str((float(x))))))



Will give an error -ans 


“one”, “two”


1.0, 2.0


1 , 2

Correct
Correct! The float will first convert into string and output such as <class 'float'> which cannot be converted into int. 

5.
Question 5
What will be the output of the following code:

sample_dict = {1: 'Coffee', 2: 'Tea', 3: 'Juice'}
for x in sample_dict:
    print(x)



(1, 'Coffee')

(2, 'Tea')

(3, 'Juice')


‘Coffee’, ‘Tea’, ‘Juice’


{1 2 3}


1 2 3

Correct
Correct! The default values printed from a dictionary are keys. 

6.
Question 6
What will be the output of the recursive code below?

def recursion(num):
    print(num)
    next = num - 3
    if next > 1:
        recursion(next)

recursion(11)



2 5 8


2 5 8 11


11 8 5 2


8 5 2

Correct
Correct! The values printed have difference of 3, but printed in opposite order. 

7.
Question 7
What will be the type of time complexity for the following piece of code:

def bigo(numbers):
    for i in numbers:
        print(numbers)

bigo([1, 7, 13, 19])



Constant Time


Logarithmic Time


Quadratic Time


Linear Time

Correct
Correct! The single for loop will have linear time depending on the size of the input sequence. 

8.
Question 8
What will be the output of the code below:

str = 'Pomodoro'
for l in str:
if l == 'o':
    str = str.split()
    print(str, end=", ")



[‘Pomodoro’, ‘modoro’, ‘doro‘, ‘ro’]


['Pomodoro']


Will throw an error


[‘P’, ‘m’, ‘d’, ‘o’]

Correct
Correct! The first time split() function is used, the str variable will convert into a list over which split() cannot be used and will give an error. 

9.
Question 9
Find the output of the code below:

def d():
    color = "green"
    def e():
        nonlocal color
        color = "yellow"
    e()
    print("Color: " + color)
    color = "red"
color = "blue"
d()



green


yellow


blue


red

Correct
Correct! The color variable will retain the value from the nonlocal variable from e()

10.
Question 10
Find the output of the code below:

num = 9
class Car:
    num = 5
    bathrooms = 2

def cost_evaluation(num):
    num = 10
    return num

class Bike():
    num = 11

cost_evaluation(num)
car = Car()
bike = Bike()
car.num = 7
Car.num = 2
print(num)



5


10


2


9

Correct
Correct! The value of the global variable will remain unchanged. 

11.
Question 11
Which of the following is the correct implementation that will return True if there is a parent class P, with an object p and a sub-class called C, with an object c?

1 / 1 point

print(issubclass(C,c))


print(issubclass(P,C))


print(issubclass(C,P))


print(issubclass(p,C))

Correct
Correct! It can be read as C is sub-class of P.

12.
Question 12
Django is a type of:

1 / 1 point

Full-stack framework


Asynchronous framework


Micro-framework

Correct
Correct! Django is a Full-stack framework.

13.
Question 13
Which of the following is not true about Integration testing:

1 / 1 point

It is where the application is tested as a whole.


Primarily dealt by the tester.


Tests the flow of data from one component to another.


It combines unit tests.

Correct
Correct! This is the case with system testing.

14.
Question 14
While using pytest for testing, it is necessary to run the file containing the main code before we can run the testing file containing our unit tests.

1 / 1 point

True


False

Correct
Correct! The main file must be saved to keep it updated but it is not required to be executed. We have to import it into our testing file. 

15.
Question 15
What will be the output of the code below:

class A:
   def a(self):
       return "Function inside A"

class B:
   def a(self):
       return "Function inside B"

class C:
   pass

class D(C, A, B):
   pass

d = D()
print(d.a())



Function inside A


No output


None of the above


Function inside B

Correct
Correct! The class A comes before class B in terms of the parent classes of class D.
